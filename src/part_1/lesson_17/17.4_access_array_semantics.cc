/*
A safer alternative is to use the at() member function:

// gets element at position 2
cout < < integers.at (2);

// the vector::at() version of the code above in
Listing 17.4, line 11:
cout < < integers.at(index);

at() performs a runtime check against the size() of the
container and throws an exception if you cross the boundaries
(which you shouldnâ€™t anyway).
Subscript operator ([]) is safe when used in a manner that
ensures bound integrity, as in the earlier example.<< inte
