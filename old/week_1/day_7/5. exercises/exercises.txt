Exercises
1. 
   int columns = 10, rows = 10;
    int zero = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < columns; ++i)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < rows; ++j)
        {
            cout << zero;
        }

        cout << endl;
    }

2. 

for (int i = 100; i <= 200; i += 2)
    {
        cout << i << endl;
    }

    return 0;

3. 

 int counter = 100;

    while (counter <= 200)
    {
        cout << counter << endl;

        ++counter;
    }

    return 0;

4.

 int counter = 100;

    do
    {
        cout << counter++ << endl;
    } while (counter <= 200);

5. no increment so endless loop

6. no loop body because of unexpected semi colon after closing parenthesis

7. loop wont start since the first condition evaluates to false;

8. no break statement therefore case will fall through
