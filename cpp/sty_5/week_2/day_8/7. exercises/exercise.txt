Quiz:


1. What operator is used to determine the address of a variable?
ans: &

2. * 

3. A pointer is a variable that acts as a pointing address in the memory, of a variable. a pointer could access 
a variable assigned to it, its value and its address.

4. The address corressponds to the address in memory that a variable is stored. while the value refers to the value of the variable that is stored.

5. The indirection operator helps the pointer access the value of the variable inside a pointer while the address of operator displays the actual address of a variable in memory.

6. const int * ptrOne = integer is constant but pointer address could be changed. pointer address is constant therefore cannot be changed.


Exercises

1. a. declares a pointer 
   b. declares an integer variable
   c. declares a pointer that points to the address of vTwo variable


2. unsigned short * pAge = &yourAge;
    *pAge = value;

3. *pAge = 50

4. int main()
{
    using namespace std;

    int v_int;
    int *p_int = 0;

    p_int = &v_int;

    *p_int = 40;

    cout << v_int << endl;

    return 0;
}


5. *pInt is a wild pointer 

6. pVar pointer without a indirection operator was used to assign 9;
